# 1. Introduction 

In this short introduction, we'll see what is a bot and how does it work.     
As an example, we will start by making a request to Nike API to fetch new and soon to come releases.    

## Requirements 
To run introduction.py, you will need:    
- Python 3 and `pip`    
- `requests` module    
Install it with `pip3 install requests` or with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Getting started
Find `introduction.py` and run:     
```python3 introduction.py```    

Replace marketplace/language "FR" values inside the `parameters` var with "US" and "en" to fetch US releases.
